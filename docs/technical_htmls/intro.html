<pre><code>The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a United Kingdom based organization whose mission statement it is to further open the platform of computer development to people of all ages. In aligning themselves with this goal, they have produced a micro-computer called the Raspberry Pi, a sub-$40 computer with output pins to allow the computer to interact with other electronic devices. This has made it a huge part in the Maker community, offering hobbyists and  newbies alike an affordable way to experiment and create new methods of human-computer interactive systems. 
	With this further proliferation, many technologies have been released specifically tailored to the Pi, and among these is the GoPiGo platform, a method of creating a mobile, drivable unit. Using the combination of these two technologies, along with the standard platform in computer vision technology – OpenCV – as well as many popular algorithms in graph searching and edge/object detection, we’ve developed a methodology for emulating the experimental    self-driving cars of Google, Uber, and the like.
